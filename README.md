My first C++ project to poke around with bits, bytes and graphics.

You need to go get the vector and matrix classes from here to make it work.

I took the Bresenham algorithm from here:

And the BMP part from rasterrain:

Copy all the files into a directory on Linux or OSX and type "make"

it should work well from there.
