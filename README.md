This is pretty much the only thing I have written in C++


The vector and Matrix libraries are written by the legendary Song Ho Ahn.
I probably could have written those myself, but it was a huge time saver to borrow his.

You can find them here:

I took the Bresenham algorithm from here:

And the BMP picture export from rasterrain:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/rasterrain/


Copy all the files into a directory on Linux or OSX and type "make"

it should work well from there.
